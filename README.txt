How To Run:

    1. Once extracted to some folder, use git bash to open a git terminal for this location.
        You must cd into 413-project2(Where this README is located) and where index.py should be found
    
    2. ensure that all line endings are LF not CRLF
        This command should work
            git config --global core.autocrlf false
        This was an issue for us and we changed it in VSCode(bottom right)

    3. Then in the Git bash shell, run the following command:
            python index.py
        Make sure to have python installed, along with java
        This should all work within the shell
